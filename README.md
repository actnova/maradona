This is a project building up a stm32f4 platform for company-wise usage.

The platform is based on official STM32F4Cube firmware.

Unlike traditional Keil based project, which is usually self-contained, this project intentionally builds up a source code tree, with code files deliberately placed in different folders, just like many open source projects do (especially linux kernel, ti starterware, ti bluetooth stacks).
