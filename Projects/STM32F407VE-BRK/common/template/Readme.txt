You can copy this folder to your own folder.

You can rename the <template> folder name to whatever you want.
You can rename the template.uvproj file name to whatever you want.
And you can find/replace the string "template Configuration" to "SomethingElse Configuration" in template.uvproj if you feel suffered from OCD (Obsessive compulsive disorder). :)
