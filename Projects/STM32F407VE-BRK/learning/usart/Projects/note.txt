Refine Setup/Teardown
Need new test case for USART interrupt (not dma)
Need to reset the hardware after close, clear all the error status.
Try FW1.2 merge
Try Fingerprint Code
irq_enabled should be removed out of usart.c/usart_test.c

////////////////////////////////////
A new hidden dependency found. dma/uart IRQ Handler need GLOBAL. DONE
split tx/rx pin config? DONE
All uart tx/rx learning test broken if we change test data to something other than globals in usart.c DONE
GPIO Clock (similar with that of DMA)
